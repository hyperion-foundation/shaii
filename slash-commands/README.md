Shaii - Slash Command
---

Slash Command is a feature to interact with a bot more convenient and efficient (native). This feature is using the [Discord Application Commands API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands).
The old style command (we call it, **legacy command**) is still remain available. So, you can interact with the bot with **2** different ways.

Slash Command is still **under experimental**, which means this feature is not 100% usable. If you want to contribute the project, you can do a **pull request**. All pull requests will be reviewed at first before the code get pushed.
