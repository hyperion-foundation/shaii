Shaii - Legacy Command
---

Legacy command is the most common way to interact with a bot. Legacy command is more time-consuming and not so convenient. This is the first way when we developed Shaii. Legacy command on Shaii can be used on different prefixes (e.g. **!**, **?**, etc). You can edit the prefix on the `.env.example` file.

Legacy command is 100% usable, but if you want to add/change something on some commands, you can do a **pull request**. All **pull request** will be reviewed at first before the code get pushed.
